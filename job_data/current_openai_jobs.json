Achieving this goal requires combining deep research into improving our current architecture, datasets and optimization techniques, alongside long-term bets aimed at improving the efficiency and capability of future generations of models. We are responsible for integrating these techniques and producing model artifacts used by the rest of the company, and ensuring that these models are world-class in every respect. Recent examples of artifacts with major contributions from our team include GPT4-Turbo, GPT-4o and o1-mini.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nAs a member of the architecture team, you will push the frontier of architecture development for OpenAI's flagship models, enhancing intelligence, efficiency, and adding new capabilities.\n\nIdeal candidates have a deep understanding of LLM architectures, a sophisticated understanding of model inference, and a hands-on empirical approach. A good fit for this role will be equally happy coming up with a creative breakthrough, investing in strengthening a baseline, designing an eval, debugging a thorny regression, or tracking down a bottleneck.\n\nThis role is based in San Francisco. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Design, prototype and scale up new architectures to improve model intelligence\n\n - Execute and analyze experiments autonomously and collaboratively\n\n - Study, debug, and optimize both model performance and computational performance\n\n - Contribute to training and inference infrastructure\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have experience landing contributions to major LLM training runs\n\n - Can thoroughly evaluate and improve deep learning architectures in a self-directed fashion\n\n - Are motivated by safely deploying LLMs in the real world\n\n - Are well-versed in the state of the art transformer modifications for efficiency\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

    "descriptionPlain": "About the team\nApplied Evals defines what good looks like for safe, advanced AI systems. We turn complex, high-value workflows into clear, reproducible signals that guide model training and product quality. Our work bridges frontier customers and models, ensuring improvements show up where users experience them. We combine hands-on, unscalable efforts with systems that others can extend, creating a compounding loop of model improvement.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe\u2019re hiring product-minded engineers to design and build evals and harnesses that capture real-world quality for advanced AI systems. You\u2019ll own the loop from prototyping with users to building reliable pipelines and integrating signals into training stacks. This role sits at the center of model improvement. The systems you design will directly shape how models behave, accelerate their reliability, and raise the standard for what customers expect.\n\nYou\u2019ll collaborate closely with research and product teams and work across the stack, from backend pipelines to user-facing interfaces. The work includes evaluating multi-turn and tool-using systems, designing agent harnesses, and applying reinforcement learning and related methods in production settings.

We prioritize safety, reliability, and responsible AI deployment over unchecked growth.\n\nAbout the role\n\nAs a software engineer on the Fleet High Performance Computing (HPC) team, you will be responsible for the reliability and uptime of all of OpenAI\u2019s compute fleet.\u00a0 Minimizing hardware failure is key to research training progress and stable services, as even a single hardware hiccup can cause significant disruptions. With increasingly large supercomputers, the stakes continue to rise.\n\nBeing at the forefront of technology means that we are often the pioneers in troubleshooting these state-of-the-art systems at scale. This is a unique opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and devise innovative solutions to maintain the health and efficiency of our supercomputing infrastructure.\n\nOur team empowers strong engineers with a high degree of autonomy and ownership, as well as ability to effect change. This role will require a keen focus on system-level comprehensive investigations and the development of automated solutions. We want people who go deep on problems, investigate as thoroughly as possible, and build automation for detection and remediation at scale.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Build and maintain automation systems for provisioning and managing server fleets.\n\n - Develop tools to monitor server health, performance, and lifecycle events.\n\n - Collaborate with clusters, networking, and infrastructure teams.\n\n - Partner with external operators to ensure a high level of quality.\n\n - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies.\n\n - Continuously improve automation to reduce manual work.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you have:\n\n - Experience managing large-scale server environments.\n\n - A balance of strengths in building and operationalizing.\n\n - Proficiency in Python, Go, or similar languages.\n\n - Strong Linux, networking, and server hardware knowledge.\n\n - Comfort digging into noisy data with SQL, PromQL, and Pandas or any other tool.\n\nPrior hardware expertise is not required for this role.\n\nBonus Skills:\n\n - Experience with low level details of hardware components, protocols, and associated Linux tooling (e.g., PCIe, Infiniband, networking, power management, kernel perf tuning)\n\n - Knowledge of hardware management protocols (e.g., IPMI, Redfish).\n\n - High-performance computing (HPC) or distributed systems experience.\n\n - Prior experience developing, managing, or designing hardware.\n\n - Familiarity with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity.\u00a0\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI\u2019s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nQualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment in accordance with applicable law, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act.

By focusing on risks that we can quantify and where our efforts can make a tangible difference, we aim to ensure that our models are ready for the complex, real-world environments in which they will be deployed.\n\nThe two pillars of our approach are: (1) harnessing improved capabilities into alignment, making sure that our alignment techniques improve, rather than break, as capabilities grow, and (2) centering humans by developing mechanisms and interfaces that enable humans to both express their intent and to effectively supervise and control AIs, even in highly complex situations.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nAs a Research Engineer / Research Scientist on the Alignment team, you will be at the forefront of ensuring that our AI systems consistently follow human intent, even in complex and unpredictable scenarios. Your role will involve designing and implementing scalable solutions that ensure the alignment of AI as their capabilities grow and that integrate human oversight into AI decision-making.\n\nThis role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\nWe are seeking research engineers and research scientists to help design and implement experiments for alignment research. Responsibilities may include:\n\n - Develop and evaluate alignment capabilities that are subjective, context-dependent, and hard to measure.\n\n - Design evaluations to reliably measure risks and alignment with human intent and values.\n\n - Build tools and evaluations to study and test model robustness in different situations.\n\n - Design experiments to understand laws for how alignment scales as a function of compute, data, lengths of context and action, as well as resources of adversaries.\n\n - Design and evaluate new Human-AI-interaction paradigms and scalable oversight methods that redefine how humans interact with, understand, and supervise our models.\n\n - Train model to be calibrated on correctness and risk.\n\n - Designing novel approaches for using AI in alignment research\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Are a team player \u2013 willing to do a variety of tasks that move the team forward.\n\n - Have a PhD or equivalent experience in research in computer science, computational science, data science, cognitive science, or similar fields.\n\n - Have strong engineering skills, particularly in designing and optimizing large-scale machine learning systems(e.g., PyTorch).\n\n - Have a deep understanding of the science behind alignment algorithms and techniques.\n\n - Can develop data visualization or data collection interfaces (e.g., TypeScript, Python).\n\n - Enjoy fast-paced, collaborative, and cutting-edge research environments.\n\n - Want to focus on developing AI models that are trustworthy, safe, and reliable, especially in high-stakes scenarios.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity.\u00a0\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI\u2019s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nQualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment in accordance with applicable law, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act.

    "descriptionPlain": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe Applied team safely brings OpenAI's technology to the world. We released ChatGPT; Plugins; DALL\u00b7E; and the APIs for GPT-4, GPT-3, embeddings, and fine-tuning. We also operate inference infrastructure at scale. There's a lot more on the immediate horizon.\n\nOur customers build fast-growing businesses around our APIs, which power product features that were never before possible. ChatGPT is a prime example of what is currently possible. We simultaneously ensure that our powerful tools are used responsibly. Safe deployment is more important to us than unfettered growth.\n\nThe Fraud Engineering team works within our Applied Engineering organization identifying and responding to fraudsters on our platform. We are looking for a software engineer with anti fraud & abuse experience to help architect and build our next-generation anti-fraud systems.\n\n\nIN THIS ROLE, YOU WILL:\n\n - Design and build systems for fraud detection and remediation while balancing fraud loss, cost of implementation, and customer experience\n\n - Work closely with finance, security, product, research, and trust & safety operations to holistically combat fraudulent and abusive actors on our system\n\n - Stay abreast of the latest techniques and tools to stay several steps ahead of determined and well resourced adversaries\n\n - Utilize GPT-4 and future models to more effectively combat fraud and abuse\n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU:\n\n - Have at least 5 years of software engineering experience in backend and data systems.\n\n - Have at least 2 years experience in fraud or abuse analysis, investigation, and/or operations\n\n - Can dive into our codebase, intuit how it works, and be able to have a strong intuition for suggestions that will lead us to a stronger engineering position.\n\n - A voracious and intrinsic desire to learn and fill in missing skills. An equally strong talent for sharing that information clearly and concisely with others\n\n - Are comfortable with ambiguity and rapidly changing conditions. You view changes as an opportunity to add structure and order when necessary\n\n - Experience in Machine Learning techniques is a plus, but not required\n\nOur tech stack\n\nOur infrastructure is built on Terraform, Kubernetes, Azure, Python, Postgres, and Kafka. While we value experience with these technologies, we are primarily looking for engineers with strong technical skills and the ability to quickly pick up new tools and frameworks.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products.

This includes work on full stack policy problems such as building methods for public inputs into model values and understanding impacts of anthropomorphism of AI. We aim to translate nebulous policy problems to be technically tractable and measurable. We then use this work to inform and build interventions that increase societal readiness for increasingly intelligent systems. Our team also works on external assurances for AI with an aim for increasing independent checks and forming additional layers of validation.\n\nAbout the role\n\nWe are looking to hire exceptional research scientists/engineers that can push the rigor of work needed to increase societal readiness for AGI. Specifically, we are looking for those that will enable us to translate nebulous policy problems to be technically tractable and measurable.\n\nThis role is based in our San Francisco HQ. We offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nIn this role, you will enable:\u00a0\n\n - Set research and strategies to study societal impacts of our models in an action-relevant manner and figure out how to tie this back into model design\n\n - Build creative methods and run experiments that enable public input into model values\n\n - Increasing rigor of external assurances by turning external findings into robust evaluations\n\n - Facilitating and growing our ability to effectively de-risk flagship model deployments in a timely manner\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\u00a0\n\n - Are excited about OpenAI\u2019s mission of building safe, universally beneficial AGI and are aligned with OpenAI\u2019s charter\n\n - Demonstrate a passion for AI safety and making cutting-edge AI models safer for real-world use.\n\n - Possess 3+ years of research experience (industry or similar academic experience) and proficiency in Python or similar languages\u00a0\n\n - Thrive in environments involving large-scale AI systems and multimodal datasets\n\n - Enjoy working on large-scale, difficult, and nebulous problems in a well-resourced environment\n\n - Exhibit proficiency in the field of AI safety, focusing on topics like RLHF, adversarial training, robustness, LLM evaluations\n\n - Have past experience in interdisciplinary research\n\n - Show enthusiasm for socio-technical topics\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

    "descriptionPlain": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nOpenAI\u2019s mission is to ensure that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We believe achieving this goal requires thoughtful engagement with public policy stakeholders, key industrial leaders, and the broader community affected by AI. Our Global Affairs team builds trusted, collaborative relationships with public officials and the broader policymaking ecosystem to inform and support the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. We also develop partnerships with a range of external parties to increase access to the computing power needed to make AI accessible to as many people as possible.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nOur infrastructure-related efforts are increasingly vital to this work. We are building out our capacity to engage deeply in these areas and seeking someone with appropriate skills and experience to help us develop OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure public policies and partnerships. This work involves consideration of complex financial incentives, export policy, global trade arrangements, infrastructure security considerations and a variety of other factors that affect the availability and cost of AI compute around the world. This work will directly support OpenAI\u2019s Stargate and OpenAI for Countries initiatives.\n\nAs the Infrastructure Policy and Partnerships Specialist on OpenAI\u2019s Global Affairs team, you will support OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure goals by developing policy proposals, collaborating with third party industry and advocacy organizations, and communicating with regulators and U.S. and foreign government officials.\n\nInternal collaboration is as essential to this role as external engagement. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment between policy strategy, GTM, finance, security, technical deployment, and OpenAI\u2019s values. This role will include project management work, internal coordination and organizational collaboration, and thought leadership.\n\nThis role can be based in either Washington, DC or San Francisco, CA.
